  The Token Engineering Commons is divided into 11 Working Groups
  that  collaborate horizontally and represent the Cultural Build of the TEC,
  implemented to promote our Vision: advance token engineering through enabling
  the creation of ethical, safe, resilient and diverse economic systems to
  benefit societies around the world. 


  Working Groups are founded on the Nobel-Prize winning research of economist Elinor Ostrom, who developed 8 principles to effectively govern a commons through decentralization. 


  Below are descriptions of each of the Working Groups and their contact information. 


  You can find more about our Mission, Vision and Values in our [Handbook](https://token-engineering-commons.gitbook.io/) and [Forum](https://forum.tecommons.org/).
