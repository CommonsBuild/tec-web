  1. An emerging engineering discipline focused on holistic systems design and
  the theory, practice and tools used to design and verify tokenized ecosystems
  i.e. cyptoeconomic systems and their simulation using tools like
  [cadCAD](https://cadcad.org/).

  2. A discipline of responsibility; adhering to the highest principles of ethical conduct (from ethical engineering)

  3. A community pushing forward the field of token engineering in theory and practice. (See more Modeling Crypto Protocols as Complex Systems, TE Process)
commonsBody: Resources that groups of people (communities, organizations) create
  and manage for individual and collective benefit. These resources are held
  collectively, not owned privately (see Fractal Ownership, Wiki and Automating
  Ostrom)

radBody: The Token Engineering Community is working on components and libraries
  needed to create cyber-physical commons. We have better tools for coordination
  than ever before!

communityBody: Token Engineering is truly a transdisciplinary field, reflected
  by the amazing humans who are drawn to the Token Engineering Commons. We are
  engineers, scientists, researchers, educators, ambassadors, philosophers,
  AR/VR game designers, digital nomads, activists, artists, edgewalkers and
  pioneers.
