  1. An emerging engineering discipline focused on holistic systems design and
  the theory, practice and tools used to design and verify tokenized ecosystems
  i.e. cyptoeconomic systems and their simulation using tools like
  [cadCAD](https://cadcad.org/).

  2. A discipline of responsibility; adhering to the highest principles of ethical conduct (from ethical engineering)

  3. A community pushing forward the field of token engineering in theory and practice. (See more Modeling Crypto Protocols as Complex Systems, TE Process)
commonsBody: Resources that groups of people (communities, organizations) create
  and manage for individual and collective benefit. These resources are held
  collectively, not owned privately (see Fractal Ownership, Wiki and Automating
  Ostrom)

  ## Our goal is to become a Schelling Point for the token engineering community.

  Our economic layer will fund projects that discover, develop and proliferate the best practices for engineering safe tokenized economies, while aligning our collective success with the individual benefit of token holders.

  
  Our social layer is even more important, as it will unite the token engineering field around the ethical principles, standards, tools and methodologies that emerge as this nascent field advances.

  ## Our Commons operates from a prosocial, human-centered perspective and prioritizes the advancement of token engineering over short-term profits.
  
  Integrity, curiosity, constructive inquiry, presence and gratitude are foundational for maintaining mutual respect within our growing community.
  We encourage our members to be radically open source, non-hierarchical, transparent in their intentions and accountable for their actions.

defiBody: "## A shift from building pieces and parts, toward using established
  engineering practices for the next generation of decentralized economies and
  infrastructure."

communityBody: Token Engineering is truly a transdisciplinary field, reflected
  by the amazing humans who are drawn to the Token Engineering Commons. We are
  engineers, scientists, researchers, educators, ambassadors, philosophers,
  AR/VR game designers, digital nomads, activists, artists, edgewalkers and
  pioneers
